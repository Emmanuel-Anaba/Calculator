I really want to use formik here

Each button has its own value that gets passed into a variable called resultStorage or smth else

There'll be a <p> or <h1> tag to display what is currently in resultStorage

When the user hits enter, i eval(resultStorage) and it shows immediately on the <p> or <h1> tag

There'll be an ans button that saves the last evaluated stuff to localStorage and retrieves it when the button is clicked

A way of replacing * with x,
